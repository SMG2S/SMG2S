# Overview
Sparse Matrix Generator with Given Spectrum


- Support of generating of both Non-Hermitian and Non-Symmetric sparse matrix

- The generated matrices are naturally Sparse with non-trivial sparsity pattern

- Given Spectrum: the spectrum of generated matrix is the same as the one specified by the users

- Sparsity Patterns is Controllable (in some sense)

- it is able to very efficiently generate high dimension matrices
